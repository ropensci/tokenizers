tokenizers
----------

An R package that collects functions with a consistent interface to convert natural language text into tokens.

[![Travis-CI Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/lmullen/tokenizers.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/lmullen/tokenizers)

### Installation

To get the development version from GitHub, use [devtools](https://github.com/hadley/devtools).

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("lmullen/tokenizers")
```

### Examples

The tokenizers in this package have a consistent interface. They all take either a character vector of any length, or a list where each element is a character vector of length one. The idea is that each element comprises a text. Then each function returns a list with the same length as the input vector, where each element in the list are the tokens generated by the function. If the input character vector or list is named, then the names are preserved, so that the names can serve as identifiers.

``` r
library(magrittr)
library(tokenizers)

### Contributing

Contributions to the package are more than welcome. One way that you can help is by using this package in your R package for natural language processing. If you want to contribute a tokenization function to this package, it should follow the same conventions as the rest of the functions whenever it makes sense to do so.
