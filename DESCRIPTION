Title: Fast, Consistent Tokenization of Natural Language Text
Version: 0.2.2
Date: 2018-06-23
Description: Convert natural language text into tokens. Includes tokenizers for
    shingled n-grams, skip n-grams, words, word stems, sentences, paragraphs,
    characters, shingled characters, lines, tweets, Penn Treebank, regular
    expressions, as well as functions for counting characters, words, and sentences,
    and a function for splitting longer texts into separate documents, each with
    the same number of words.  The tokenizers have a consistent interface, and
    the package is built on the 'stringi' and 'Rcpp' packages for  fast
    yet correct tokenization in 'UTF-8'.
